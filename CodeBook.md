##### Variables/Measurements Name
__Steps involved in Variable name cleaning__

1. Select mean and standard deviation variables from the complete features list using grep function
```R
grep("\\b-std()|-mean()\\b", features$V2)
```

2. Replace `'('`, `')'`, `'-'` with `''` using `gsub()`

3. Make lower case using `tolower()`
